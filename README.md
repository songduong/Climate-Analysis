# Climate-Analysis

##### In this project I did some pretty neat climate analysis based on a couple of CSV files, using Python and its packages, especially sqlalchemy.

###### data_engineering.ipynb
This is the notebook where I cleaned up the csv files.

###### database_engineering.ipynb
This is the notebook where I created a database and established a connection for data analysis.

###### climate_analysis.ipynb
This is the notebook I had the most fun with. In this notebook I did some Precipitation analysis, station analysis, and temperature analysis, then I created an API using Flask.

###### app.py
Here is the Flask API file.
